        <p>
          I'm a dedicated Information Technology student at Haldia Institute of
          Technology, proficient in C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data
          structures, with a strong grasp of Git and GitHub. With a track record
          of solving over 100 questions on LeetCode and participating in the AWS
          Summit India, I bring a passion for coding, creative problem-solving,
          and technical learning. I've honed my skills through webinars,
          personal projects like a URL shortener and a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and a
          content aggregator tool, showcasing my abilities in practical
          applications. I'm also an active participant in social initiatives,
          contributing to awareness campaigns during the pandemic, and I enjoy
          the balance of reading and watching movies.

        <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
        <p>
          Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns
          marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O".
          The objective of the game is to form a line of three of your symbols
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does.
          <b>Technology used</b
          ><span>â€¢ Used Numpy (python library) for this game.</span>

        <h3>URL Shortener</h3>
        <p>The main function of a URL shortener is to reduce the length of web addresses so
            users can memorize them and share them.
            Allows users to reduce the length of the address significantly and allow them to
            customize the link.</p>
